### Auth Protocols & Schemes

- OAuth
- OpenID Connect
- SAML
- CAS

### OAuth
!!! not: bir uygulumaya tum izinleri vermektense sadece gerekli olan izinleri vermek, ben google a login olayim ama benim google a login oldugumu goren servis sadece izin verdigim ismim ve mailimi alabilsin

OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords  


### OAuth

- Authz protocol, doesnt provide Authentication,
- doesnt allow federated SSO


### OpenID Connect
!!! not: oauth iliskisine degin
!! kisalt

OpenID is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol. Promoted by the non-profit OpenID Foundation, it allows users to be authenticated by co-operating sites (known as relying parties, or RP) using a third-party service, eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own ad hoc login systems,

*OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.* It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner

### OpenID Connect

\end{center}


### OpenID Connect
!!! not: openid idp isi nasil isliyor  

An identity provider, or OpenID provider (OP) is a service that specializes in registering OpenID URLs or XRIs. OpenID enables an end-user to communicate with a relying party

With OpenID, your password is only given to your identity provider, and that provider then confirms your identity to the websites you visit

### OpenID Connect

\end{center}


### OpenID Connect
#### Security
- Registration between RP and OP is mandatory, can be done with public metadata exchange and selfregistration
- JSON messages can be signed and/or encrypted with the help of asymmetric keys (public keys published in JWKS) or symmetric keys (client secret)

### SAML
!!! giris slayti  
!!! tek olayi sso degil fakat genellikle onun icin kullaniliyor

The primary SAML use case is called Web Browser Single Sign-On (SSO).

### SAML
\begin{center}

\end{center}


### SAML
#### Security
- Registration between SP and IDP is mandatory, can be done with public metadata exchange
- XML messages can be signed and/or encrypted with the help of asymmetric keys (public keys published in metadata)

### CAS 
!!! giris slayti  

The Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a single *sign-on* protocol for the web.

Its purpose is to permit a user to access multiple applications while providing their credentials (such as userid and password) only once. It also allows web applications to authenticate users without gaining access to a user's security credentials, such as a password.

### CAS 
#### Security
- No obligation to declare CAS clients in CAS server (open mode)
- Trust between CAS client and CAS server relies on CAS server certificate validation


### Single Sign On

!!! not: open id den alinan id tokenler birden fazlo uygulamada login olabilir, session acabilir yanit sso 
!!! not: cas zaten sso implementasyonu, samlin ana kullanim amaci zaten sso implement etmek

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID and password to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.

### Web Single Sign On protocols
- Based on the principle of an authentication server, a lot
of SSO standards have been created:
    - CoSign (Weblogin), Pubcookie, Webauth, CAH, CAS, WebID, BrowserID (Persona), SAML, WS-*, Liberty alliance, SAML 2, Shibboleth, OpenID, OpenID Connect...
- But nowadays, only a few are really used:
    - CAS, SAML 2, OpenID Connect

### Protocol Comparison
- CAS: simple protocol, no strong security, fits internal usage
- SAML: complex protocol, very used for SaaS authentication, good security, well established
- ***OpenID Connect:*** easy adoption with new technologies (JSON/REST/OAuth2), mobile ready, good security, *still not wide spread

***The work on DIF SIOP DID Profile specification has moved to OIDF AB WG to work on a new SIOP v2 specification that will either introduce breaking changes to the DIF SIOP DID Profile specification or will replace it with an implementation guide document on how to use SIOP v2 in an SSI context.***


### DID SIOP

#### Terminology

### Introduction
\framesubtitle{DID SIOP}
!!! not: While this specification focuses on the integration of Identity Wallets in the form of browser extensions/ plugins, or smartphone apps, it does not prevent implementers using the proposed flow in different scenarios as well, e.g., between two web services with pre-populated DIDs.
!!! not: cevir, nota ekle

An everyday use case that the Decentralized Identity community identified is the sign-up or login with web applications. Nowadays, this is often achieved through social login schemes such as Google Sign-In. While the Decentralized Identity community has serious concerns about social login, the underlying protocol, OIDC, does not have these flaws by design. SIOP DID provides great potential by leveraging an Identity Wallet, e.g., as a smartphone app, on the web. This will increase and preserve the user’s privacy by preventing third-parties from having the ability to track which web applications a user is interacting with.

### Introduction
\framesubtitle{DID SIOP}

#### Purpose
The main purpose is to sign up with/ login to an RP (Relaying Party), i.e., web application. It assumes the user operates a mobile or desktop browser or a browser-based app that can respond to SIOP requests according to this specification.

#### Goals
- Staying backward compatible with existing OIDC clients and OPs (OpenID Provider) that implement the SIOP specification which is part of the OIDC core specification as per [OIDC.Core] to reach a broader community.
- Adding validation rules for OIDC clients that have DID AuthN support to make full use of DIDs.
- Not relying on any intermediary such as a traditional centralized public or private OP while still being OIDC-compliant.


### Protocol Flow
\framesubtitle{DID SIOP}

- First, the user clicks on the sign up or login UX element. The RP will then generate the redirect to openid://<SIOP Request> which will be handled by the SIOP.

- The SIOP will generate the <SIOP Response> based on the specific DID method that is supported. The <SIOP Response> will be signed and optionally encrypted and will be provided according to the requested response mode.

### Protocol Flow
\framesubtitle{DID SIOP}
!!! not: detaylari anla not al

- Unlike the OIDC Authorization Code Flow as per [OIDC.Core], the SIOP will not return an access token to the RP

- SIOP also differs from Authorization Code Flow by not relying on a centralized and known OP. The SIOP can be unknown to the RP until the user starts to interact with the RP using its Identity Wallet 

-  OIDC Authorization Code Flow is still a useful approach and should be used whenever the OP is known, and OP discovery is possible, e.g., exchanged or pre-populated DID Document containing an openid element in the service section.

- The SIOP flow allows to integrate Identity Wallets with plain OIDC clients if they implemented the SIOP specification. In contrast, using DID AuthN as the authentication means in the OIDC Authorization Code Flow would require integration with the OP vendor itself.
